0x14. C - Bit manipulation

bit manipulation involves manipulation of individual bits within binary representation of data. it allows efficient handling of binary data, bitwise operations and compact storage of flag s or boolean values

data is typically stored in binary format, with each bit representing a binary digit(0 or 1).

the most commonly used bitwise operations are:
AND(&),OR(|), XOR(^) and NOT(~)
